**Definitions**
Bot
  - a program you can chat with (in Telegram) which executes a pre-defined set of commands as the user wants. A bot usually automates some things and helps human to concentrate on other buisness.
Our group(s)
  - The ones prefixed/suffixed with "OSM" or "OpenStreetMap" in their name.
We
  - The OpenStreetMap Community developing and utilizing the Bot
Interactions (with our groups):
  - Interactions are joins, sending messages, leaves and sending media. In this case you are a member of one or more of our groups.


**General**
This Bot exists to keep spammers away from our groups. For that the bot collects some data about each member in our group:
  - Your telegram internal id
  - Your username
  - Your first- & last name
  - Your access level (will mostly be 'user')
  - A comment about you issued by one of the admins (should be empty usually)
  - The telegram internal id of the issuer of the comment (should be 'NULL' usually). You cannot view that information
  - Timestamp (When was your record added to the database)

To view the data the Bot has saved about you, just issue `/mydata` in a private chat with the bot.

**When will this data be collected?**
The Bot creates a record in our database (see "General" section) if you join one of our groups. If you chat with the bot in private and aren't in any of our groups, then the bot won't save anything about you. The bot updates the record everytime you interact with our groups. If you chat with the bot in private and the bot already created a record for you because you were/are in one of our groups, then it also updates your record.

**When will this data be deleted?**
In order to protect our groups you cannot force us to delete your data because we need that data we collect in order to be able to ban you just in case you are spamming. However we keep records from our members for 2 months and then delete them as they would have never existed. But the Bot will always recreate it when you start to interact with our groups again.

But if you were banned or promoted to one of our admin levels your record won't get deleted. We keep data from banned users for our ban list and to be able to unban you in case we did a terrible mistake. We keep the data until we decide to delete them. And we keep data from promoted ones because otherwise they couldn't execute their power.

**How can I view the data being collected about me?**
Just start a private chat with our bot and issue `/mydata` to view them.
